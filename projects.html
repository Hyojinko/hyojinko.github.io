                                Based on research and experience in multimodal data processing, this project analyzes and predicts patient personal health record data composed of various formats such as images and text using "Explainable AI" technology to support nursing surveillance systems. Additionally, by utilizing continuous learning, the system learns changing patient conditions and disease patterns over time to support real-time patient monitoring.

                                This project proposes a No-Code AI-based personalized healthcare service framework to enable enterprises and users without coding knowledge to receive support for their desired services through specialized data analysis. The framework introduces a code generation agent based on Code-BERT. It analyzes users' natural language commands to understand requirements, and then the code generation agent writes SQL queries to retrieve necessary data from health record databases. The retrieved data is then processed through generated analysis algorithms to support personalized medical decision-making.

Based on this research, I presented the paper "No-Code AI-based Personalized Healthcare Service Framework" at the KDBC conference.

                                These projects were foundational research projects I participated in to build the groundwork for my research. Through these three projects, I researched the direction of personalized AI services, federated learning, continuous learning, knowledge graphs, VQA, natural language processing, image processing, continuous service provision, learning from new data, and multimodal data processing. This experience enabled me to develop the capabilities to lead future personal research and projects.

                                In "Research on Auto-Expanding Knowledge Graph-based Conversational AI Framework," I utilized natural language processing to extract core concepts from user utterances and supported generating similar responses based on knowledge graphs. Additionally, by applying PolarisX, an auto-expanding knowledge graph developed in our laboratory, the system automatically expands the knowledge base and supports sustainable services that can respond to new data inputs. I conducted a survey for this project and designed the initial architecture. Based on this work, I published the paper "Trends in Empathetic AI Agent Technology for Mental Health" in the Journal of KIISE.

                                Subsequently, based on ideas from continuous learning and federated learning concepts learned in networks, I applied a method that enables end-devices to share learning while maintaining security through federated continuous learning. By proposing this idea, I was selected for "Research on Advanced Conversational AI Platform based on Continuous Learning" and "Research on Personalized AI Platform based on Federated Continuous Learning."

                                Through these research experiences and achievements, I have acquired the capabilities necessary to design AI systems that continuously learn and grow, and to provide trustworthy AI services.
